              <h3>Amano Pool Dashboard</h3>
            </a>

            <p>
            <h5>The Problem </h5>Pool technicians spend a lot of time checking pool levels,
            which takes time away from finding and helping new clients.</p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            <h5>The Solution: </h5>The Amano founders engineered a really neat solution:
            small devices that float unobtrusively in pools and periodically collect data on pool pH, alkalinity, and
            Chlorine levels. </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            <h5>So, where do I come in?</h5> I built a Node.js (Express and EJS) application that displays current pool
            levels, historical data,
            alerts, and recommendations. With attractive data visualization and intuitive UI/UX, the web app enables
            pool technicians
            to know what needs done at a glance. Read more about it <a href="/portfolio/amano">here</a>.</p><br />

              <h3>ELITechGroup, Inc.</h3>
            </a>

            <p>
            <h5>The Problem </h5>ELITechGroup, Inc. kept its registration, product, and icensing information on paper,
            which made it difficult to find specific data at any given moment.</p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            <h5>The Solution </h5>ELITechGroup decided to digitize its paper forms and make a web application
            with several autopopulating reports, making it easy to find relevant information. </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            <h5>So, where do I come in?</h5> I worked with a team to build out the client-side of the application.
            Using JS (supported heavily by jQuery), we built out a series of reports that take parameters
            through dropdowns and checkboxes, request data from a PHP API, and return neatly formatted, printable data
            tables.
            I designed and developed 85% of the web pages and JS functionality. Read more about it <a

              <h3>Camera Shopping (in development)</h3>
            </a>

            <p>
            <h5>The Problem </h5>Getting into photography is daunting: there's so much equipment, all of it costly,
            that it can become overwhelming to figure out where to begin.</p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            <h5>The Solution </h5>I decided to build the app that would have saved me hundreds of hours when I was
            getting
            into photography: a recommendation system that guides users through the most important questions,
            then returns some great options (complete with clear explanations of why it's recommending each camera).
            </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            <h5>Progress</h5> I have collected about 50 points of data each for nearly 2500 cameras. I scraped the data
            from a variety
            of sources on the web using the BeautifulSoup library in Python and am processing the data using the Pandas
            library. The client
            side is essentially complete, as is the data modelling for MongoDB.
            <br /><br />
            The data can currently be accessed in JSON format from the homepage.
            Once the data is fully processed and tagged, I will train an ensemble of supervised machine learning models
            to make excellent recommendations in real time
            (recommendations will update for each question answered so that users can focus on what's most important to
            them).
            A limited beta version of the website will be available 2/10/2021.
